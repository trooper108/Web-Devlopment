            <p>
              Somnath is a magnificent temple situated in Sagar Kant of
              Saurashtra in Gujarat state. One of the 12 holy Jyotirlingas of
              Lord Shiva is in Jyotirlinga here in Somnath. Somnath is also
              mentioned in Rigveda. This temple of Somnath has been very
              attractive in front of many destructive foreign invaders who want
              to lure and convert to the temple glory. Whenever the temple has
              tried to destroy it, then it has been built again.

              Many Hindu texts provide a list of the most sacred Shiva
              pilgrimage sites, along with a guide for visiting the site. The
              best known were the Mahatmya genre of texts. Of these, Somnatha
              temple tops the list of jyotirlingas in the Jnanasamhita â€“ chapter
              13 of the Shiva Purana, and the oldest known text with a list of
              jyotirlingas. Other texts include the Varanasi Mahatmya (found in
              Skanda Purana), the Shatarudra Samhita and the Kothirudra

              The rebuilt temple as found in the ruined form in the 19th-century
              and the current temple used recovered parts of previous temple
              with significant artwork. The new temple has added and integrated
              the new panels with a few old ones, the color of the stone
              distinguishing the two. The panels and pillars with historic
              artwork were and are found in the south and southwest side of the
              Somnath temple.
